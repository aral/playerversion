PlayerVersion
=============

**'What Flash player version are you running?'**

How many times have you had to a user that question and then run them through the process of finding out their Flash Player version?

Instead, you can just point them to http://playerversion.com

Or, you could many moons ago when I made it. I haven't really touched Flash in the last few years so the detection code (it screen scrapes the Adobe web site) has deteriorated. If anyone is interested in updating it, here's the source and I'm happy to get pull requests. (I just FTPed it down from the site for the time being; I'll look for the version.swf's FLA file if anyone needs it.)
